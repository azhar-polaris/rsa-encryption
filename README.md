# RSA Public Key Encryption Project

This project demonstrates RSA public key encryption in a Node.js backend using Express, with a React frontend.

## Overview

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an asymmetric encryption algorithm widely used for secure data transmission. In this project, we implement RSA encryption to securely transmit data between a frontend and a backend.

## Features

- Generate RSA key pair (public and private keys)
- Encrypt data using the recipient's public key
- Decrypt data using the recipient's private key

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- React

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azhar-polaris/rsa-encryption.git
